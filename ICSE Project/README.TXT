Q4.  WAP in Java using if..else if to print two strings in alphabetical order , using compareTo method.

 Q5. Given that 1st Jan 2014 is a Wednesday, compute the day of Feb 28th, 2021. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. There is one exception to this rule: If a year is divisible by 100, but not by 400, it is not a leap year (e.g. 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, etc.) However, since 2400 is divisible by 400 it is a leap year. WAP to accept an year and verify whether it is leap year  or not.
Q6. Generate a class called “Toys” and four toy objects such as Robot, Car, Lego and Doll.
Create a function to calculate the percentage of sale of each toy. Then rate the toys as Very good,Good,Average and Poor depending upon the percentage sale.

 Percentage sale= (Sale/Total produced)*100
% sale				Rate
>85				very  Good
>65 &<=85 			Good
>40&<= 65			Average
<=40				Poor


Q7. A special two-digit no is such that when the sum of the digits is added to the product of its digits, the result is equal to the original two-digit number.
Example:
Consider the number 59.Sum of digits = 5+9=14
Product of its digits = 5 x 9 = 45
Sum of the digits and product of digits = 14 + 45 = 59
Write a program to accept a two-digit number. Add the sum of its digits to the product of its digits. If the value is equal to the number input, the message “special-two digit number” otherwise, output the message “Not a special two-digit number”.

Q8. WAP in Java to find the Prime factors of a number. The word prime factor means
  those factors which are prime in nature and by which the number itself is completely divisible (1 will not be taken as prime number).

Q9.WAPusing switch case to find the volume of  a cube,a sphere and a cuboid. For an incorrect choice, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
1.	Volume of a cube= s*s*s
2.	V olume of a sphere= 4/3*pie*r*r*r
3.	Volume of a cuboid-l*b*h

Rs 30,001 and above	20%	12%
WAP to accept basic salary of an employee.Calculate and display the gross salary. P rint the information in the given format:
Basic	DA	SA	Gross_sal
			


Q12. You want to buy an old car from ‘Sale and Purchase’ where you can get a car in depreciated price. The depreciation valueof a car calculated on its show roomprice and the number of yearsit has been used. The depreciated valueof a car is calculatedas per the tariff goven below:

1	10%
2	20%
3	30%
4	50%
Above 4years	60%

Q13. A  number is said to be unique if digits  of a number are not repeated in it. WAP to accept a number and check whether the number is unique or not. The program displays the message accordingly:-
Sample Input:- 5463
Sample Output:- It is an unique number
Q14.  WAP to accept two numbers and check whether they are twin prime  or not.
[Hint:- Twin Prime numbers are the prime numbers whose difference is two.]
Eg(5,7)(11,13)
Q15.A number is aid to be DUCK if the digit 0 present in it. WAP to accept a number and check whether the number is DUCK or not. The program displays a message (The number must not begin with zero)
Sample Input: 5063
Sample Output: IT IS A DUCK no
Q16. Read a single dimension array of size 15 and print the list of prime numbers and perfect numbers, if any, under suitable heading.
Q17. Read a single dimension array of 15 length and double the value of each element and store it back in the same array.
Q18. Declare an SD array of integer type of length 30, take a variable size (which will hold the total number of values stored in the array) and perform the following-
I.	Insert a number ‘n’ at ‘pos’ position of the array by shifting the elements to the right side of the length.
II.	Delete a number present at ‘pos’ position and rearrange the array to fill in the gap.
III.	Display the final array
Perform the above program using do – while loop and switch-case construct.
Q19. Search an element in the array using linear search method and print a suitable message.
